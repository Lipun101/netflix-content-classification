# **Netflix Data Analysis and NLP**
**Overview**\
This project involves analyzing the Netflix dataset and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights and perform various tasks such as content clustering and genre prediction. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content distribution and leverage machine learning models to make predictions based on content descriptions.

**Dataset**\
The dataset used for this project is the Netflix titles dataset, which includes information on various movies and TV shows, including their descriptions, countries, genres, types, and ratings.

**Methodology**\
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.\
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of content types, countries, genres, and ratings.\
NLP Model:\
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text descriptions into numerical vectors.\
Logistic Regression: Building a model to predict content type based on descriptions.\
Content Clustering:\
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features for clustering.\
K-Means Clustering: Categorizing content into clusters based on features.\
Similarity Search: Using cosine similarity to find and rank the most similar plot descriptions.
